Critical assessment of project and improvements:

1. Mouse scroll wheel controls. Sroll wheel can be used to "swipe" rather than clicking and dragging with a mouse. While playing the game as a user I found the smooth swiping interface of the game very satisfying, but clicking and dragging it with a mouse is slightly tedious. The mouse scroll wheel was an obvious choice for this function as it is not been bound to any other game function and suits the "swiping" style of the game interface in a mouse (rather than touch) context.

2. Added a settings page for the game as a framework for adding future functionality, most notably an in-game mute function, control options, and visual theming options. The idea behind this work-in-progress addition is to open an obvious space in the project for other developers.

3. Removed useless monetisation code that was not being used and was clogging up game logic wherever the sequence of levels needed to be checked. Since monetisation was not implemented in the original game and there is no plan for it to be implemented by the original developer or in this fork, it made sense to remove this code before it caused problems later on in development.

4. Added comments in areas where code was changed to aid in future development.
